# Data-Structures---Some-Assignments
Hi there! This is a repository containing some codes (in C Language) of basic data structure programs. In my codes, I've applied concepts of Linked Lists, Stacks , Queues , Circular Queues, Trees , Graphs and so much more!

You'll be able to find the codes for the following programs : 

1. Performing operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, saddle point - on matrices
   - solved by using pointers and 2D Arrays

2. A database program to store the members of a Pinnacle Club + perform operations on them - add member, delete member and display list (in order + in reverse)
   - solved by using linked lists

3. Converts numeric expressions from infix to postfix form + evaluates the answer
   - solved by using linked lists and stacks
    
4. Creating a circular queue by taking numbers as input and performing operations (add, delete, display) on the queue    
   - used a circular queue of size 5.
   - functions created : enqueue(), dequeue(), display() 

5. Creating a Binary Search Tree and performing operations such as - Insert / Delete / Search / Display - on the BST.
   - made the tree with the help of nodes (doubly linked list) 
   - used the concept of recursion in creating the functions to perform operations on the BST 
   
6. Searching for an element - in a specified tree  
   - created a tree with fixed nodes and values
   - a simple approach to find whether a number is present in the tree or not
